Chatbot from scratch

Custom train your bot using TensorFlow and nltk library.

Mood.json consists of the questions and all possible answers. We train the bot to understand the words and classify the tags.

I have not created GUI for thsi project as it was just practice project.

I trained the model for epoch = 1000 and batch_size = 8, I got accuracy of 97% for 6 tags.


I made the bot to understand the mood and also tells jokes.
